<p>
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
    <br />the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
    <br />galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
    <br />five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
    <br />unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
    <br />Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
    <br />PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum..
